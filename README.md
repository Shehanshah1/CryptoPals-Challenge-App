CryptoPals Challenge App

This repository provides solutions to the CryptoPals Cryptography Challenges, structured across three branches:

Master: Contains the complete application, including all cryptographic solutions, UI (C#), and integrated components.

Test Suite: Focuses on the C++ code and Google Test Suite for testing cryptographic functions.

Challenge Codes (C#): Implements the cryptographic challenge solutions using C# for the user interface and application logic.

Features

Full-stack cryptographic solutions with a front-end UI and back-end.

Automated unit testing for code integrity and regression prevention.

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/Shehanshah1/CryptoPals-Challenge-App.git

Checkout the desired branch:

bash

Copy code

git checkout [branch-name]

Testing

Use the Test Suite branch to run unit tests via Google Test Suite, verifying the cryptographic implementations.

Disclaimer: The Test Suite tested the codes before the team chose to switch to C# for the interface. Google Test Suites does not support C#. The initial C++ codes were tested.
